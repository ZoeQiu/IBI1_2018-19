In this practical, I learned to fork and clone repos from others in Git and I also learned to make change in the Gitkarken.
But I still have some questions: First, why I could not find the practical3 folder in the IBI_19_20, but in the IBI_18_19. The position of the index document was also wrong. It was found in the practical4 folder instead of the practical3 fold.
